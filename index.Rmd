## Rob Cavanaugh

</center>

<div style = "color:#ECEFF1;">

I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders and TL1 pre-doctoral fellow in the Institute for Clinical Research Education at the University of Pittsburgh. I am also a clinical speech-language pathologist specializing in neurorehabilitation.

Outside of my day job, you can find me with my wife, Amanda - somewhere outdoors, typically in a national park, and ideally on top of a mountain.

### Research

My long-term research goal is to improve everyday communication and quality of life outcomes for people with aphasia and related neurogenic communication disorders. My research strives to identify and resolve implementation gaps in aphasia rehabilitation, improve patient access to evidence-based care, and enhance treatment specification and effectiveness. I'm also interested in statistics and data science, programming (R + python + js), data visualization, and science communication.

### Recent Publications

```{r results='asis', echo = FALSE}
# Note the special double pipe so we modify the CV object in place
CV %<>% print_section("publications") 
```

### Selected Presentations

```{r results='asis', echo = FALSE}
# Note the special double pipe so we modify the CV object in place
CV %<>% print_section("presentations", glue_template = "poster") 
```

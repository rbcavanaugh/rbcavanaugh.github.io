I'm an Assistant Professor at the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute for Health Professions with appointments in Communication Science and Disorders and Genetics Counseling. I specialize in quantitative methods, serving as a statistical co-investigator, consultant, and mentor for research initiatives. My skillset includes hierarchical/mixed-effects models, Bayesian methods, item-response theory, and I'm developing expertise in causal inference methodology. I'm committed to education and open science, advocating for experiential learning approaches that build strong statistical foundations for future rehabilitation and health science researchers and practitioners.

My background as a speech-language pathologist in neurorehabilitation shapes my teaching and research perspective. Seeing disparities in care outcomes drove my PhD work at the University of Pittsburgh, where I examined treatment dosage, mechanisms, and components for post-stroke aphasia. My current research integrates rehabilitation health services, population health, and data science, analyzing insurance claims and electronic health record data to examine healthcare outcomes and improve service delivery. I'm also co-investigator on studies examining treatment dosage more broadly in interventions in the field of speech-language pathology.

I've developed multiple web-applications, websites, and R packages for science dissemination and implementation using R, Javascript, and Python. These include computer adaptive testing platforms, the allofus R package, and a repository for statistics training resources for allied health researchers. I also have expertise in Natural Language Processing methods via NIH-NRSA funded training in computational linguistics and discourse analysis of disordered language. If you've made it this far, I encourage you to look through this website which includes summaries and links to these projects.  

Outside of my day job, you can find me and my wife Amanda exploring the outdoors with our two dogs, Murphy and Willa.

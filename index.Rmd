I'm a research data analyst at the [***Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics Center***](https://ohdsi.northeastern.edu) (OHDSI) at Northeastern University's Roux Institute in Portland, ME. I work with Dr. Brianne Olivieri-Mui and Dr. Louisa Smith at the intersection of health services research, epidemiology, and biostatistics/data science, primarily using insurance claims and electronic health record data to examine disparities in health care outcomes. I also mentor PhD students in data analytics and statistics, act as statistical CO-I/consultant for several funded studies in communication sciences and disorders and develop open-source software in R. 

I'm a clinical speech-language pathologist by training with expertise in stroke and traumatic brain injury rehabilitation. My doctoral research focused on improving the effectiveness of aphasia rehabilitation services from complementary perspectives: (1) specifying the active ingredients of aphasia treatments, (2) evaluating patterns of treatment-related change in discourse-level communication, and (3) examining the current state of clinical speech-language services for individuals with post-stroke aphasia. I'm passionate about improving statistical methodology and increasing open-science practices within rehabilitation research.  My long term goals are to integrate my clinical background, translational research training,  expertise in health services research, and quantitative skills to collaborate on high impact research that improves real-world rehabilitation outcomes. 

Outside of my day job, you can find me and my wife Amanda exploring the outdoors with our two dogs, Murphy and Willa.

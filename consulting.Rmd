Occasionally, I take on side projects as a consultant.
These projects typically focus on data-related needs for studies in the field of communication sciences and disorders or in related fields. The scope of this work might include:

- Developing reproducible data processing pipelines in R
- Building R {shiny} apps or websites (see "Apps & Websites" page for examples)
- Statistical consulting (especially related to mixed-effects models)
- Data visualization using tools like ggplot, plotly, leaflet, or highcharter
- Cleaning or synthesizing data using Natural Language Processing tools

I'm happy to consider other types of (related) projects or consulting work. Please connect with me and we can discuss project fit, scope, and cost.

<!-- I'm well-versed in writing reproducible R code to combine, clean, and save data - taking raw -->
<!-- data from many types of formats and generating an analytical data set that is ready for statistical modeling. Writing reproducible code to handle data processing makes our research more -->
<!-- transparent, helps to minimize errors that are common when manually working with data,  -->
<!-- and is often more efficient because it takes less time overall, and allows us to re-run  -->
<!-- the processing stream in the case that any errors are identified in the initial data.  -->


<!-- I really enjoy building shiny apps and have built quite a few over the past few years. These interactive web-apps have been as simple as creating interactive figures to better visualize the results -->
<!-- from different studies, educational visualizations for small-N study analytical methods,  -->
<!-- to a full-scale R package and shiny-app for the computer adaptive Philadelphia Naming Test -->
<!-- and Aphaisa Communication Outcome Measures. There are some examples of these apps on the Apps & Websites page.  -->
<!-- I've also been involved in a number of studies primarily in a statistical role. I'm  -->
<!-- especially interested in projects that use mixed-effects models and Bayesian methods but -->
<!-- have experience and knowledge with a wide variety of methods. I'm also well-versed in -->
<!-- data visualization tools in R such as ggplot, highcharter, plotly, and leaflet. In addition to using -->
<!-- these methods in my own work, I also have experience -->
<!-- mentoring PhD students and other researchers in learning to using these methods. -->
<!-- I've engaged with NLP tools throughout my PhD. Examples of this might include applying lemmatizers, tokenizers, part-of-speech taggers, calculating measures like type-token ratio, word information measure, developing core lexicon sets to orthographic transcripts, or implementing ML tools such as BERT for estimating semantic similarity.  -->
